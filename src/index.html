<!-- Create a simple form that allows users to submit a new post. Implement the onCreatePost method to send a POST request to an API endpoint and save the post data.

Fetch a list of posts from an API endpoint using a GET request. Implement the onFetchPosts method to retrieve the posts and display them in your Angular application.

Implement pagination by retrieving a limited number of posts from the API at a time. Add buttons or links to navigate to the next or previous page of posts.

Add error handling to your HTTP requests. Handle situations where the request fails or returns an error response. Display appropriate error messages to the user.

Implement a feature to update an existing post. Create an edit form that allows users to modify the content of a post and send a PUT request to update the post on the server.

Implement a feature to delete a post. Add a delete button for each post and send a DELETE request to remove the post from the server.

Add authentication to your HTTP requests. Include an authentication token in the request headers to authenticate the user and protect sensitive API endpoints. -->
