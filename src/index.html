<!-- 
    Task List:
    Create a component that displays a list of tasks. Define an array of tasks in the component class, with each task having a name and a boolean property indicating whether it is completed. Use ngFor to iterate over the array and display each task's name. Use ngIf to conditionally display an "Completed" label next to completed tasks.

    User Authentication:
    Build a component that handles user authentication. Display a login form with input fields for username and password. Use ngIf to show the login form if the user is not authenticated. Once the user logs in, display a welcome message with the user's name using ngIf.

    Pagination:
    Create a component that displays a paginated list of items. Define an array of items and set a fixed number of items per page. Use ngFor and slice the array to display the items for each page. Use ngIf to conditionally display pagination controls (e.g., previous and next buttons).

    Filtering and Sorting:
    Build a component that allows filtering and sorting of a list of products. Define an array of products with properties like name, price, and category. Display the list of products using ngFor. Implement filtering by name and category using input fields and ngIf. Add sorting functionality by price using ngFor and Array.sort() method.

    Conditional Styling:
    Create a component that displays a list of items. Each item should have a quantity property. Use ngFor to iterate over the array and display each item's name and quantity. Use ngIf to apply conditional styling to the quantity, e.g., if the quantity is less than 5, display it in red. -->
